# Cat-Whisker-Sensory-Extension-Wearable
With this project, I wanted to take the previous whisker sensory extension wearable and make it lighter, more cost-effective, as well as easier to construct.
A cat whisker earable that simulates the type of spatial/environmental information that a cat might derive from its whiskers.
